                  <p>It was through their collective efforts that we were able to bring this video to life.</p>
                  <p>This is a creative advertisement about apple juice, and since none of us had much filming experience, we discovered that the actual execution involved far more steps and coordination than we initially anticipated.</p>

                  <p>At the very beginning, after finalizing the story, I created a storyboard to visualize the narrative. Once the team had a clear picture, executing the plan became much easier. </p>
                  <p>Soon after, we realized that having all the team members act in the video would be challenging, as everyone was juggling multiple responsibilities. So, I started recruiting actors. </p>
                  <p>Here, I’d like to express my gratitude to my friends Morgan, Regina, Yana, and Eliza. Thanks to their voluntary participation, we were able to achieve such an amazing performance.</p>

                  <p>Coordinating everyone’s schedules and meeting the necessary conditions for the shoot was a complex task, but fortunately, everything was resolved perfectly in the end.</p>
